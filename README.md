#  Single-Cycle Datapath in Logisim  

This project implements a **Single-Cycle CPU Datapath** in **Logisim**, inspired by the classic MIPS architecture. The datapath supports instruction execution in a single clock cycle and provides the ability to run assembly programs by loading them into the **Instruction Memory**.  

The design allows real-time observation of register values, ALU operations, and memory interactions, making it an excellent educational tool for understanding **computer architecture and processor design**.

##  Features  
- **Instruction Execution**: Supports running assembly language programs by loading them into the instruction memory.  
- **Register File Access**: View intermediate values stored in registers during execution.  
- **ALU Operations**: Handles arithmetic and logical operations as per instruction set.  
- **Memory Operations**: Includes instruction memory, data memory, and register file.  
- **Control Signals**: Generated by the main control unit (CU) to manage execution flow.  
- **Single-Cycle Execution**: Each instruction completes in a single clock cycle.

## Components Used  
- **Instruction Memory (IM)** – Stores program instructions.  
- **Register File** – Stores register values, accessible for viewing.  
- **ALU** – Performs arithmetic and logical operations.  
- **Data Memory** – For load/store instructions.  
- **Control Unit (CU)** – Generates control signals (`RegWrite`, `ALUSrc`, `MemRead`, `MemWrite`, etc.).  
- **Multiplexers (MUX)** – Control data flow.  
- **Sign Extension Unit** – For immediate values.

## How to Run  
1. Open the project in **Logisim**.  
2. Load your assembly program into the **Instruction Memory**.  
   - Convert your assembly code into machine code (binary/hex).  
   - Insert it into the instruction memory component.  
3. Enable the clock and run the program step-by-step or continuously.  
4. Observe:  
   - Register values (intermediate results).  
   - ALU outputs.  
   - Data memory interactions.

##  Educational Use  
This project is ideal for:  
- Students learning **Computer Organization and Design**.  
- Understanding **MIPS-like CPU design**.  
- Visualizing how assembly instructions execute in hardware.  
- Experimenting with modifications (e.g., pipelining, hazard handling).  

---

##  Future Enhancements  
- Add **pipelining** for multi-cycle execution.  
- Support more complex instructions (branching, jumps, etc.).  
- Add an assembler script to directly convert assembly into machine code for memory loading.
